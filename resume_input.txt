Summary
I'm a bit of a generalist with a good ability to dive deeply into a wide variety of areas to solve very specific problems. I don't memorize a lot of syntax in advance because I can easily lookup what I need as I go and once I'm in groove on a new project I can quickly take off. I don't let go of a problem until it is solved, and that is always an iterative process. Some examples would be how to invest in equities to make 28% annual returns, how to break down a large project like egress filtering with fifty sites around the world, a diverse set of devices from servers and network equipment to end user devices, and figure out what is the next achievable step with the greatest impact. And then when I'm done, and I get closure on the project, I push all the details of the project out of my head so I can start working on something else. In this way, I can do the big picture strategic planning, and also dive down into the specifics of implementation, which is an incredibly valuable skill set. But if you test me on my Python or PowerShell syntax on an empty notepad, I can tell you in advance, I'm like a monkey typing Shakespeare, it takes a few tries to get out all of the syntax errors. The design and organization of my code is solid though.

I have been programming and developing business solutions from scratch since I was twelve years old processing telephone surveys and creating custom reports for my father who was a business consultant. From that I gained essential skills for analyzing business processes and the importance of providing reliable solutions and understanding your customer's true needs.

Since then I have worked in legal field as a systems engineer, software developer, and in management at the level of director. I have a passion for building and improving systems whether is developing a case management system flexible and scalable enough to handle millions of documents and dozens of customized practice areas or setting up secure reliable networks and remote access for multinational offices.

I take security very seriously and incorporate a healthy skepticism into everything I build. There is always more that can be done to lock down and layer security, and much of it can be done without spending much money or inconveniencing your user base. What it takes hard work and discipline from IT, not fancy software.

I realized early on that end-user access to email and a web browser was a primary risk to system compromise. With this in mind all workstations were designed so that users could not modify anything outside of their user profile and document workspace, all scripting was disabled, and no executables could be run from places a user could modify. This, combined with profile cleanup routine run at login, led to a very stable and secure environment and it was all done with native Windows tools that have been available since XP.
